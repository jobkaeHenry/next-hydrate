## Introduction

`next-hydrate` is a powerful library that provides universal hydration utilities for Next.js App Router applications using React Query v5. It automatically handles the complexity of server-side rendering, incremental static regeneration, static site generation, and client-side rendering.

## Why next-hydrate?

Managing React Query state across different Next.js rendering strategies can be challenging. `next-hydrate` solves this by:

- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects whether you're in SSR, ISR, SSG, or CSR mode
- **Performance Optimized**: Built-in concurrency control, payload size limits, and memory optimization
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Developer Friendly**: Simple API with powerful features and integrated logging

## Key Features

### Universal Rendering Support

Works seamlessly across all Next.js rendering modes:
- **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering)
- **ISR** (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- **SSG** (Static Site Generation)
- **CSR** (Client-Side Rendering)

### Performance First

- Concurrency control for parallel fetches
- Payload size monitoring with automatic CSR fallback
- Memory-efficient server-side QueryClient
- Query deduplication

### Developer Experience

- TypeScript-first with excellent IDE support
- Integrated logging and debugging
- React Query DevTools support
- Comprehensive error handling
