## Prerequisites

Before installing `next-hydrate`, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **Next.js** 13.4.0 or higher
- **React** 18.2.0 or higher
- **React Query** v5.0.0 or higher

## Package Installation

Install `next-hydrate` and its peer dependencies using your preferred package manager:

### npm

```bash
npm install @jobkaehenry/next-hydrate @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add @jobkaehenry/next-hydrate @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @jobkaehenry/next-hydrate @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

## Peer Dependencies

The following packages are required as peer dependencies:

```json
{
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.0.0",
  "next": ">=13.4.0",
  "react": ">=18.2.0",
  "react-dom": ">=18.2.0"
}
```

If you don't have these packages installed, make sure to install them before using `next-hydrate`.

## Verify Installation

To verify that the installation was successful, you can import the library in your code:

```typescript
import { getHydrationProps, QueryProvider } from '@jobkaehenry/next-hydrate';
```

If the import works without errors, you're ready to start using `next-hydrate`!

## Next Steps
